  <td colspan=92 style='mso-ignore:colspan'>Coinciding with the growing number
  of data sources has been an explosion of visualization, analytical, and
  hybrid tools, often fueled by the open-source community. Once data are
  collected, these tools will provide new ways for analysts to convey complex data
  and ideas, such as driver surveillance trends, to decision makers in a clear
  and logical format (e.g., Hans Rosling â€™ s Trendalyzer,<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Technical Appendix<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Table 2). Cloud-based platforms have
  evolved from desktop-based Esri software and leverage the open-source
  framework, social coding, and collaboration to provide researchers new
  opportunities to combine complex multisource big data with newly created
  virtual forums (e.g., Google Earth Engine and social modeling platforms). In
  addition to new analytic techniques, digital driver surveillance can build on
  advances in the way science is conducted. One example is the Open Science
  Framework, which has pioneered online project spaces that enable others to
  make changes or add on to the project without affecting the original (
  https://osf.io/ ). Another example is rOpenSci ( https://ropensci.org ), an
  effort funded by the Sloan Foundation to wrap scientific application
  programming interfaces in a manner that is readily accessible to analysts and
  researchers. This new approach sets the groundwork for collaborative,
  iterative, and adaptive management of ID driver surveillance
    models.</td>

  studies with replication studies for subsequent joint publication; such
  paired studies replace the same number of unrelated studies, potentially
  reducing Type I error ( Nuzzo, 2014 ). Observational studies and clinical

  decisions transparent, we pre-registered our study hypotheses, detailed
  methods and procedures, and the complete data analysis plan (including

  in the experiment were concrete nouns denoting manipulable objects or
  animals. There were 30 animal probes and 30 man-made probes, repeated across
  the three tasks (global association, size matching and specific-feature
  matching), each with a unique target word for each task. The distracters in
  all conditions were target items from other trials that did not have
  overlapping features or a global association with the probe. No restrictions
  were placed on the number of times a word could be used (mean number of
  repetitions Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; 2, SD Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; 1.4, range Â&nbsp; =
  Â&nbsp; 6); however the number of repetitions was equivalent between
  conditions. For the words in each trial (probe, target, and distracter) we
  collected measures of familiarity, imageability, manipulability, lexical
  frequency, word length, and number of words, averaging across all the words
  in a single trial, and compared trials across relevant conditions. Ratings of
  familiarity and imageability were taken from the MRC psycholinguistic
  database ( Wilson, 1987 ). Ratings of manipulability, familiarity, and
  imageability were also collected on a 7 point scale (1<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>â€”<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>low, 7<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>â€”<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>high) from a separate cohort of 11
  healthy adult participants who did not take part in the scanning sessions
  (familiarity and imageability ratings were collected for targets with missing
  values in existing databases). Lexical frequency was taken from the SUBLEX-UK
  database ( van Heuven et al., 2014 ).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;

  feature:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>t (58) Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp;
  1.43, p Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; .156). Manipulability ratings were higher for
  action than colour trials as expected ( t (58) Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; 9.47, p
  Â&nbsp; &lt; Â&nbsp; .001). Imageability was also higher for colour than
  action trials ( t (58) Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; 7.61, p Â&nbsp; &lt; Â&nbsp; .001).
  No significant differences were observed for manipulability and imageability
  for global vs. size (manipulability:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;

  </span>t (58) Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; .322, p Â&nbsp; = Â&nbsp; .748). Finally, a
  different set of 13 participants rated the extent to which they found it
  necessary to generate a spatiotemporal context to complete the specific
  feature matching conditions (e.g., colour and action judgements), on a seven
  point scale (1<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>â€”<span

  storage options can pose daunting challenges for researchers and
  institutions. Identifiable and sensitive data must be kept secure. Storage
  solutions must meet the needs of researchers during the active data
  collection phase of a study while not posing insurmountable hurdles to data
  sharing down the line. The effort to reconcile these competing demands led
  Databrary ( http://databrary.org ) to build tools that allow researchers to
  upload session â€ê level video and flat â€ê file data to a secure web â€ê
  based server as the data are collected, thereby minimizing post â€ê study

  <td colspan=90 style='mso-ignore:colspan'>As indicated by quite some

  in psychology and neurosciences in general (Button et al.,<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>2013 ; Open Science
  Collaboration,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>2015 ). But how to
  estimate efficacy of tDCS, if it is not clear, how many unsuccessful
  experimental attempts end up in the file drawer? As discussed above, one
  possibility is to adjust for publication bias in meta- analyses. Another
  strategy is pre-registering tDCS studies and reporting their outcome,
  independent of whether the results are significant or not â€” be it in peer
  reviewed journals or platforms such as the Open Science Framework (
  https://osf.io ); this can result in more accurate estimates of efficacy.
  Moreover, allowing open access to the acquired data (open data) offers the
  opportunity that researchers could pool raw data from experiments with small
  samples but similar experimental designs. By doing so, they overcome the
  problem of under-powering, an issue that seems so fundamental in tDCS
  research.</td>
